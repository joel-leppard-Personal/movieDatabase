    ///TODO: add a way to pick movies to do this out of the database which would be an easy way to handle movies not being in the database as users can only pick from ones inside of it
    ///TODO: add all horror movies from Tmdb API to Database as well as all data (took 2 mins for 400 movies, there are 60,000. should take about 5 hours)
