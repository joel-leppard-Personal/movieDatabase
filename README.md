this is the first project that I'm uploading to GitHub. I am trying to diversify my knowledge in different applications of databases
as well as different languages.

> overview
A movie database using the TMDB API (API link: https://github.com/c-eg/themoviedbapi)
utilizes NEO4J and the neo4j + progresSQL APIs in java
A graph database connected actors, genres, production companies, etc.

> what this project has taught me
the cypher programming language syntax as well as applications for it.
a deeper understanding of different database types instead of just MySQL databases.
a deeper dive into implementations of APIs as how i can manipulate them to my advantage.
